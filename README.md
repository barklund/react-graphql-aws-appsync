This repository serves as the source code for a talk about using [React Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) for GraphQL data loading - as well as a demonstration of how simple it is to create a [GraphQL backend with AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/).

Please see [the video of the talk to understand the full context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNoDZihhWHI).

### Inspiration

This implementation is strongly inspired by [Charles Stover's post: "React Suspense with the fetch API"](https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/react-suspense-with-the-fetch-api-a1b7369b0469).
